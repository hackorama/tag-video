Tag Video 
====================

Archiving the code remains of [Mytago](http://hackorama.com/mytago/) tag system project from 2006.
Developed for J2ME/Symbian phones and was obsoleted by the smart phone era with better camera and processing power.

This code is for the tag image processing from a live video stream.

Used in this  [mytago technology demonstrator windows executable](http://hackorama.com/mytago-tag-processing-tech-demo.html).
